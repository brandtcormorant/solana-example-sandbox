# solana-example-sandbox

I'm exploring solana development!

This repo is a sandbox for my personal learning, but feel free to make suggestions in the issues.

Right now I'm working on:

- Implementing the soldev.app course using the v2 Technology Preview of @solana/web3.js
- Reimplementing @solana-developers/helpers and others to be compatible

These examples may be useful to others getting started with the v2 Technology Preview of @solana/web3.js.

I'd be happy to collaborate on any related work!

## Set up

To install dependencies:
